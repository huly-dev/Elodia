# `resource.ts` - Plugin Resource Management

## Introduction

The `resource.ts` module introduces a framework for defining and initializing resources within dynamically loadable plugins. At its core, this system allows the platform to manage and access a heterogeneous collection of resources brought in by plugins, which may include functions, classes, configurations, and other entities crucial for extending platform functionalities.

## Core Mechanisms

### Plugin and Resource Registration

Plugins are encapsulated packages of functionality. Each plugin is represented by a unique identifier (`PluginId`) and is expected to initialize its contributions to the platform during its load phase.

A plugin initializes its internal resources through a declarative interface that receives a `FactoryProvider`. This provider abstracts over the construction of resources, ensuring that resources are instantiated with their appropriate identifiers, promoting consistency and correctness.

Plugins can declare resources across various categories, with each category grouping logically related resources together. Categories and resources within them are keyed by string identifiers.

### Resource Initialization Process

Upon plugin registration, the platform walks the structure provided by the plugin and uses the `FactoryProvider` to transform declared resource placeholders into actual instances or concrete references. This process also involves namespacing resource identifiers with the plugin's identifier to prevent conflicts and ensure traceability.

This transformed object, representing all the plugin's resources, is referred to as `PluginResourcesAfterFactories`.

### Resource Access

Once initialized, resources are accessible via the namespaced identifiers, allowing the platform and other plugins to retrieve and interact with them. The retrieval process respects the strong typing enforced during resource registration, assisting in preventing run-time type errors.

## Usage

To create a new plugin with resources, the `Resources.plugin` function is used, and it receives two parameters:

- The plugin name, used for namespacing and retrieval.
- An initialization function, which the platform executes to collect the resources declared by the plugin.

A plugin declares resources in a structure mapping category names to resource definitions. During the platform's bootstrapping process, these declarations are processed into initialized resources, ready for use by the rest of the platform.

## Considerations

- The design prioritizes namespacing and strong typing to mitigate the risks associated with dynamic content loading and retrieval.
- The `FactoryProvider` constructs ensure lazy instantiation where possible, aiding in efficient resource management and initialization.
- Error handling strategies for the resource initialization process should be implemented to accommodate potential issues that may arise.
