# `model.ts` - Domain Modeling Foundations

## Introduction

The `model.ts` module defines the essential domain model structures for the Huly Platform. It sets out the core concepts such as `Doc`, `Space`, and `Classifier`, which serve as a blueprint for creating and organizing the platform's data entities. By establishing a strict schema, it lays the groundwork for extensions and ensures interoperability across various modules and plugins.

## Core Structures

### Documents and Objects

- `Doc`: The foundational interface for all document-like entities on the platform. It includes metadata such as identifiers, creation/modification timestamps, and ownership information. All persistent entities derive from `Doc`, gaining a common set of attributes beneficial for tracking and auditing.

- `Obj`: Represents generic objects within the system. Every object includes a link to its class definition (`class`), which describes its structure. This relationship forms the basis for the platform's type system.

- `Space`: A specialized `Doc` that represents a collaborative environment or workspace within the platform. It includes access control lists and privacy settings.

### Classifiers

The classifier system enables polymorphism and inheritance, leading to a flexible model where new types of documents and objects can be introduced and classified.

- `Classifier`: An abstract concept categorizing entities into `Class`, `Interface`, and `Mixin`. This allows for defining interfaces and reusable component suites alongside traditional class-based inheritance.

- `Class`: Concrete classifiers that define the structure and behavior of objects. Classes can extend other classes and implement interfaces, providing a mechanism for code reuse and polymorphism.

### Attributes and Data Types

- `Attribute`: Represents a named property of a classifier, including the property's type and any default values. Attributes are the primary way fields are defined for objects and documents on the platform.

- `DataType`: Abstracts over different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and references to other documents (`Ref<Doc>`). Custom `DataType` instances can be defined, allowing for domain-specific constraints and validations.

## Considerations

Developers extending the platform should ensure that any new entities adhere to the schema outlined in this module. For instance, creating a new document type requires extending from `Doc` and potentially adding new attributes.

When working with references (`Ref<T>`), be cautious to maintain referential integrity across the system by using valid identifiers and following the appropriate resolution mechanisms.

### Conclusion

The `model.ts` provides the structural foundation for the platform's data layer. By adhering to these structures, developers can ensure that their contributions remain consistent with the overarching domain model, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and enabling seamless integration of various platform components.
