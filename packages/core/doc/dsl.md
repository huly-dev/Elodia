# `dsl.ts` - Domain-Specific Language for Model Definition

## Introduction

The `dsl.ts` module defines a DSL that allows developers to easily describe entities and their relationships in a manner that aligns with the platform's domain model. This DSL abstracts away intricacies involved in specifying model attributes, classes, and their interrelations, allowing developers to focus on the logical structure of their data.

## Key Constructs

### Model Declaration

The DSL centralizes around the concept of a `ModelDeclaration`, which serves as a container for a collection of classifiers, including classes and attributes that together represent a business domain or a subset of it.

- `ModelDeclaration`: The principal construct for grouping all elements of a particular domain model, identified by a name.

### Class Declaration

The `ClassDeclaration` construct allows the definition of a model class, specifying inheritance and properties. It is crucial in establishing object-oriented hierarchies and relationships within the system.

- `ClassDeclaration`: Describes a class with an identifier, its superclass, and a set of structural elements which define the attributes of the class.

### Attribute Declaration

This DSL construct represents attributes that are properties of model classes. They define the shape and constraints of the data stored within instances of those classes.

- `AttributeDeclaration`: Details the characteristics of a class attribute, including its data type, label, and any default values.

## DSL Usage

Developers use the `dsl` object to define their domain models declaratively. The DSL provides methods that facilitate describing the elements of the model:

- `model`: Used to declare a new model by providing a name and a set of classifiers.
- `class`: Used to declare a new class within a model, specifying its identifier, superclasses, and a description of its structure.
- `attr`: Used to declare attributes of a class.

By using these DSL constructs, developers can efficiently map out the domain entities, leveraging the platform's type safety and model consistency.

## Implications

The DSL ensures a standardized way of defining business models across the platform. It abstracts complex type interrelations and provides a straightforward approach to describing domain-specific requirements.

While this adds a layer of abstraction, developers still need to be aware of the underlying domain model constructs and their implications within the platform.

## Conclusion

The `dsl.ts` module's DSL provides a structured way to define domain models, helping maintain a clean separation between the model definitions and the rest of the platform logic. It simplifies the process of evolving and managing the platform's data structure by offering an approachable and expressive language for domain modeling.
